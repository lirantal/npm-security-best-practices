## 1. Disable Post-Install Scripts

> [!WARNING]
> Post-install scripts are a common and recurring attack vector for supply chain attacks.
>

> [!TIP]
> **Security Best Practice**: Configure npm to disable lifecycle scripts when installing packages so any npm package, direct or indirect, cannot execute arbitrary code or commands on your system during installation.

> [!NOTE]
> **How to implement?**
> 
> Disable npm's post-install scripts when performing ad-hoc package install using the command line:
> ```bash
> npm install --ignore-scripts <package-name>
> ```
> Or, *highly recommended* at a global configuration, set npm's `ignore-scripts` configuration to `true` to disable all post-install scripts.
> ```bash
> npm config set ignore-scripts true
> ```
